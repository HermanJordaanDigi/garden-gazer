Implementation Review Request
Please conduct a comprehensive review of the codebase with the following objectives:

Gap Analysis & Issue Identification

Review the actual coded solution for any missing implementations or incomplete features
Identify any issues where Next.js and React best practices were not followed
Use web search to verify current best practices and documentation for all libraries and frameworks used in the application


Code Duplication Assessment

Since different developers worked on different phases, check for:

Duplicate files or components
Redundant functions with similar or identical logic
Overlapping implementations that could be consolidated




Documentation Verification

Search for and reference the most up-to-date documentation for any libraries or features implemented in our application
Flag any usage that doesn't align with current recommended patterns



Please document your findings with specific file paths and recommendations for improvements.
